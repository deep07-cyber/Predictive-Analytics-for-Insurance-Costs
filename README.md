🧾 Insurance Charges Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict individual medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, region, and smoking status. It follows a complete end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

📌 Features

- Handles real-world insurance dataset

- Cleaned and preprocessed data

- Exploratory Data Analysis with visual insights

- Categorical variable encoding

- Regression model training (Linear Regression / other regressors)

- Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score)

- Predicts insurance charges for new input data


🎨 Visualization Tools Used

This project uses multiple libraries for rich data visualization:

 Matplotlib → Line charts, scatter plots, bar charts

 Seaborn → Heatmaps, correlation maps, pairplots, boxplots

 Pandas Plotting → Quick dataframe-level plots


Visualizations include:

- Distribution of insurance charges

- BMI vs Charges

- Smoking status impact

- Correlation heatmap

Boxplots for outlier detection

🤖 Models Used

Linear Regression

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

Typical metrics used:

MAE – Mean Absolute Error

MSE – Mean Squared Error

RMSE – Root Mean Squared Error

R² Score – Variance explained by the model
